# Devops Tools

These are tools to help the work become easier, please clone this repository and
view the README.md file for instructions.

## Misc
This has remained an unfinished Ansible provisioner, however the template remains.
It may be useful to get ideas or check the `ansible-provision/update_hosts.py` for an
alternative to dynamic hosts.


## Suggested
I highly recommend using `ansible-provision`. Please view the `README.md` within
the subfolder on installing ansible.
